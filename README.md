# A_Speaker_Driver_Circuit_with_a_Low_Pass_Filter
Our experimental goal is to design a filter circuit capable of eliminating 10kHz noise present in the input audio while effectively playing back the input audio. To eliminate the 10kHz noise, we designed a low-pass filter with a pole near 3kHz. The simulation results of our designed circuit in PSPICE were satisfactory. However, during the soldering process, possibly due to poor soldering connections, the circuit failed to output the audio signal.
